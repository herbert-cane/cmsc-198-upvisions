Good morning. Catch your breath first. That uphill walk is a rite of passage.
Alright. Under RA 10931, your tuition is free. But we need to tag external grants. Are you a recipient?
    * [DOST Scholar] Yes, I passed the DOST-SEI exam.
        -> dost_scholar
    * [CHED Scholar] I have a CHED Merit Scholarship.
        -> ched_scholar
    * [None] None, ma'am. Just the Free Tuition Law.
        -> no_scholarship

Congrats. I need your Notice of Award. Tagged as DOST-RA 7687. Book allowance and stipend will be processed later. No grades below 5.0, okay?
Here is your clearance. Go back down to Sir Ruel at the New Admin. Oh, and one more thing...
That's the GCSU (Guidance and Counseling) next door. If the pressure gets too much—homesickness, academic stress, anything—just knock. It's free, confidential, and they have aircon. Don't be afraid to use it.

Noted. You are under the standard Free Tuition. If you need extra help for living expenses later, watch out for the SLAS (Student Learning Assistance System) announcements.
